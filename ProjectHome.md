Formulator MathML Editor is a mathematical expressions editor by Hermitech (http://www.mmlsoft.com).

Formulator is aware of presentation and content (semantics) face of MathML, and so it allows not only to visually edit, but also to calculate simple Content MathML formulas.

Formulator makes it simple to develop new software products, keenly aware of the mathematical typesetting and semantics rules. This helps to dramatically accelerates application development in computer-aided education, computer algebra systems, authoring tools, and many other applications for mathematics, science, and business.
