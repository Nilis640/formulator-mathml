This is Formulator MathML Editor version 4.0.

Formulator MathML Editor is a mathematical expressions editor 
by Hermitech (http://www.mmlsoft.com).

Formulator is aware of presentation and content (semantics) face 
of MathML, and so it allows not only to visually edit, but also 
to calculate simple Content MathML formulas.

Formulator makes it simple to develop new software products, 
keenly aware of the mathematical typesetting and semantics rules. 
This helps to dramatically accelerates application development 
in computer-aided education, computer algebra systems, authoring 
tools, and many other applications for mathematics, science, and 
business.
